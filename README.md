# Windows 10 Custom Notifications demo using Python

Shoutout to @akhiltak's inspirational-quotes project, from which I borrowed the Quotes.csv file. https://github.com/akhiltak/inspirational-quotes/blob/master/Quotes.csv
# Usage

(while in the working directory of the files):

```python .\friendly_reminders.py```

***This program, as well as the libraries it uses, were designed for Windows. I may design a fully-fledged application that is cross-platform, however.***

# Installation

1. make sure prerequisites (win10toast library) is installed: ```pip install win10toast``` 
2. git clone this repository. ```git clone https://github.com/jadenhensley/python_notifications/```

# What I learned

- Importing of ```.csv``` files to store heavy amounts of data. (motivational quotes, in this case)
- Tracking system ```date & time``` to trigger events in a script.
- Learning to use the ```win10toast``` library.
- Usage of the  ```PIL``` library to display friendly images or memes.
- Recognizing the efficient leverage that libraries provide in development of prototypes.
